# Storedsafe API ruby wrapper

This is a ruby wrapper for the Storedsafe REST-like API.

# TODO

## High Priority
- [ ] Expand defaults to rc file
- [ ] Add request method to API
- [ ] Write tests with environment control (which class should they belong to?)

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Collect configuration options for rspec in support file
- [ ] Make configuration attributes related tests based on
      support file so that rubocop passes on specs.

## Questions
- [ ] Are all fields from the rc-file needed?
