This is a ruby wrapper for the Storedsafe REST-like API.

# TODO

## High Priority
- [x] Add request method to API
- [ ] Implement error handling
- [ ] Finish implementation of API methods
- [ ] Decide what API methods should return. Would a response object add value?

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Look into persistent HTTP connection
